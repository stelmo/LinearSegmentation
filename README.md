This is a small package that performs linear segmented regression: fitting
piecewise linear functions to data, and simultaneously estimating the best
breakpoints. Three algorithm are implemented, `sliding_window`, `top_down`, and
`shortest_path`.

Convenience functions `xygroups` and `xyboundgroups` are also supplied to make
plotting easier.

## Interface
```julia
using LinearSegmentation

segments = segmentation_function(
    x_values, 
    y_values; 
    min_segment_length = minimum_segment_x_length, 
    fit_threshold = minimum_r2,
    fit_function = :r2,
    overlap = true,
)
```
Where each entry in `segments` is a tuple of indices of `x_values` used in the
segment, and a `GLM.LinearModel` (see
[GLM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/GLM.jl)), which is the fitted linear
model to that segment. Minimum segment lengths are specified with
`min_segment_length`. By default, the goodness-of-fit is measured using the
coefficient of determination. Each segment must have a minimum RÂ² of
`fit_threshold`. Root mean squared error can also be used by setting
`fit_function = :rmse`, and adjusting `fit_threshold` to a dataset dependent
error threshold. In this case, the root mean squared error must be smaller than
`fit_threshold` for each segment. By default, the end of a segment is also the
start of the next segment, but this can be changed by setting `overlap` to
`false` (resulting in disjoint segmentations).

## Generate some data
```julia
N = 100
xs = collect(range(0, 3 * pi, length = N)) .+ 0.1 .* randn(N)
ys = sin.(xs) .+ 0.1 .* randn(N)
```

## Sliding window
Uses a sliding window approach to segment the data: initially an empty segment
is made, and data added to it until `fit_threshold` is reached. Then a new
segment is made, and the process repeats until the data is exhausted. This
algorithm is the cheapest to run, but may generate worse fits due to its
simplicity.
```julia
segments = sliding_window(xs, ys; min_segment_length=1.2)

using CairoMakie
# skipped some plotting steps
for (i, (_xs, _ys)) in enumerate(xygroups(segments, xs))
    lines!(ax, _xs, _ys; color=ColorSchemes.tableau_10[i], linewidth=8)
end
```

## Top down
This algorithm recursively splits the data into two parts, attempting to find
segments that are both long enough, and have a good enough fit (set via the
kwargs).
```julia
using LinearSegmentation, CairoMakie

segments = top_down(xs, ys; min_segment_length=1.2)

# skipped some plotting steps
for (i, (_xs, _ys, _lbs, _ubs)) in enumerate(xyboundgroups(segments, xs))
    lines!(ax, _xs, _ys; color=ColorSchemes.tableau_10[i], linewidth=8)
    band!(ax, _xs, _lbs, _ubs; color=(ColorSchemes.tableau_10[i], 0.2))
end
```

## Shortest path
This algorithm is *my take* on the dynamic programming approaches used by the R
packages listed below. In essence, a weighted directional graph is constructed,
where each node corresponds to an index of `xs`, and the edge weight between
nodes corresponds to the goodness-of-fit measure between the two nodes (segment
length restrictions and maximum error are both incorporated). The shortest
weighted path that spans `xs` is the found with `Graphs.a_star` (see
[Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl)), and should correspond to
the best segmentation.
```julia
segments = shortest_path(xs, ys; min_segment_length=1.2)

# similar plotting as before can be done here...
```
